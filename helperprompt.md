We are building a social media posting agent saas tool. 
the current_context.md file gives you context on where we are. The master DevSpec has been broken down into indivual files, to make it easy to complete come in a session. after each session the current_context.md file should be updated. 

you must update the current_context file properly and include what the current file structure looks like, so its easy for the next session to pick up. You should also include all the function names and what they do in each file. This way we will avoid recreating functions in future sessions. 

Please refer to the supporting docs in the Project Files section for more context. 

Its important, that you do this step by step, guiding me through everything, including library installations. where mutliple files need to be created, please show me the name i should use and the code. 

please also put comment code in every single file so that we know what it does (especially at the top). Non-coder and students will learn from this. Please also follow the instructions written in the instructions section. 

Lets start by implementing phase1-db-setup.md
